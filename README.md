This application is an **AI-powered conversational tool** designed to simulate and manage insightful discussions between two "experts" about strategies to prevent bullying in classrooms. It allows users to either observe a live AI-generated discussion or participate as one of the experts, providing actionable insights on this critical topic.

## üöÄ Features

### 1. **AI-Driven Expert Conversations**
   - Two AI experts engage in a research-based dialogue about strategies to eliminate bullying.
   - The discussion is generated dynamically using advanced natural language processing (NLP) models.
   - Responses are carefully filtered to avoid repetition and generic statements.

### 2. **Interactive User Mode**
   - Take the role of **Expert 2** and contribute to the conversation.
   - The AI (Expert 1) responds to your input with relevant and actionable strategies.

### 3. **Seamless Mode Switching**
   - Toggle between:
     - **AI-Only Mode**: The two experts converse without user input.
     - **User Interaction Mode**: Participate as Expert 2.

### 4. **Real-Time Chat Interface**
   - Clean and intuitive chat window with:
     - Distinct avatars and styles for both experts.
     - Automatic scrolling to the latest message.

### 5. **Advanced AI Features**
   - **Repetition Avoidance**: Filters out redundant or generic responses.
   - **Semantic Similarity Checks**: Ensures all replies are unique and contextually relevant.
   - **Dynamic Prompting**: Uses a fine-tuned language model (Flan-T5) for intelligent and coherent responses.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (for frontend)
- **Python 3.8+** (for backend)
- **pipenv** (optional for Python environment management)

### Steps

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-expert-chat.git
   cd ai-expert-chat
   ```
2. **Install backend dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd api
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Start the Backend Server**:
   ```bash
   uvicorn chat:app --reload
   ```
4. **Install frontend dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```

## ü§ñ How It Works

1. **AI-Only Mode**  
   The backend uses pre-trained NLP models to generate a live discussion between two AI experts. The frontend fetches and displays these responses in real-time.

2. **User Interaction Mode**  
   Users can join as Expert 2 by typing their responses. The backend processes user input and generates a reply from Expert 1, keeping the conversation natural and engaging.

3. **Repetition Avoidance**  
   Responses are filtered to avoid redundancy using semantic similarity checks and a predefined list of ‚Äúbad responses.‚Äù
